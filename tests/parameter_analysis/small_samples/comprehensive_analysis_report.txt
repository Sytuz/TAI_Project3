COMPREHENSIVE PARAMETER ANALYSIS REPORT
========================================
Analysis Date: Tue Jun 10 02:48:37 PM WEST 2025
Dataset: small_samples

This report analyzes the performance of different parameter combinations
for the music identification system using Normalized Compression Distance (NCD).

ANALYSIS INCLUDES:
- Feature extraction performance (file sizes, generation success)
- Compression algorithm accuracy comparison
- Method comparison (Spectral vs MaxFreq)
- Format comparison (Text vs Binary)
- Compressor performance ranking

METHODOLOGY:
- Default parameters used for both methods:
  * Spectral: 32 bins, 1024 frame size, 512 hop size
  * MaxFreq: 4 frequencies, 1024 frame size, 512 hop size
- All 4 compressors tested: gzip bzip2 lzma zstd
- Both text (.feat) and binary (.featbin) formats tested
